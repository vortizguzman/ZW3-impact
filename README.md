This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the analysis and results as published in Ortiz-Guzm√°n et al. (2024) [https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-23-0739.1].
This is all within the Jupyter notebook file.

## Usage
Note that this code uses, among others, the [aostools](https://github.com/mjucker/aostools/tree/master) repository. Thus, simply install the package running
```pip install aostools```.
